		<h2> About Me </h2>

		<p>
		I was born and raised in Torrance,California. My birthday is on March 9th,1992 and I'm 25 years old. I am of Japanese descent but I can't speak it! <br> I'm 3rd generation and my parents weren't able to teach me, but one of these days I will eventually learn. One of my dreams is to travel the globe and experience what the world has to offer.</p>

		<p>Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, playing computer games, and going hiking. Ever since I was a kid, I loved the Lakers. <br> Kobe Bryant was my favorite player growing up and I attended his last game ever in which he scored 60 points! It will forever be one of my greatest memories.</p>
